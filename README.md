React + Vite Starter Template
This template provides a minimal and efficient setup to get React running smoothly with Vite, featuring Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and essential ESLint configurations for code quality.

Available Plugins
Currently, two official plugins are supported:

@vitejs/plugin-react — uses Babel for Fast Refresh and JSX transformation.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc — uses SWC for an even faster build and refresh experience.

Enhancing the ESLint Configuration
For production-grade applications, we highly recommend:

Using TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience.

Expanding your ESLint rules to be type-aware, ensuring more robust and maintainable code.

You can refer to the React + TypeScript template to quickly integrate TypeScript, along with typescript-eslint for type checking and linting.


If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
